## This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

#### The analysis is based on the data generated by the experiment described here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#### The data has been sourced from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The steps involved in sourcing the data, cleaning it to produce a tidy dataset, and calculating the averages are as follows:

1. read the training data set, the activities and the subjects into data frames
2. read the test data set, the activities and the subjects into data frames
3. combine each of the matching data sets into three further data frames
4. read the features data, which describes the actual experimental results, and take a subset of the Mean and Standard Deviation measures
5. read the activities data and replace the IDs with the activity names
6. change the column names for the activities and subjects to make them more meaningful
7. take a subset of the combined dataset to as the required data based on the required features
8. change the column names for the required dataset to make them more meaningful
9. append the required dataset to the subjects and activities
10. create a second dataset to hold the calculated averages for each feature by subject and activity
11. write this data to file
